\section*{Introduction}

Text documents have been, until recently, an underexploited
source of information due to their complex, non-numerical
structure. Low level natural language processing (NLP)
tasks as text classification, 
sequence tagging (POS-tagging, named entity recognition, ...) and 
parsing have long been tackled through bag-of-words methods 
and hidden markov models. The application of deep learning 
to NLP tasks (started around 2010s) has opened new, complementary 
and effective ways to solve these problems, eventually leading to core
innovations in high-level tasks such as question answering or 
language generation. Using feed-forward networks 
to generate low-dimensional representation of sparse, high 
dimensional word vectors; recurrent neural networks as LSTMs
to fit the sequential nature of sentences; and later on attention mechanims,
deep learning techniques have set new baselines on traditional benchmarks. 
However, the efficiency of these results is totally empirical 
and is not backed by theoretical results, in addition to having 
high computationnal costs. The article studied in this project \cite{arora2018sensing}
aims at giving some results on unsupervised text embeddings. 
\\ \\
To do so, it focusses on a compressed sensing view of the text 
embedding problem, which aims at provinding low-dimensional representation
for texts. As words can be viewed 
as very sparse vectors in the vocabulary space, providing a 
low-dimensional representation of a text can be seen as measuring 
words signals in a compressed way. The article explores this idea, 
and links compressed sensing to some LSTMs-learned text representations.
In order to evaluate such representations (through their 
performances on text classification), authors
 adapts a result in \cite{Calderbank2009CompressedL} on the quality
of low-dimensional compressed sensing representations as inputs
for a classification problem. \\ \\
In this work, we will first recall what are words and text embeddings, 
in order to recall the basic NLP background for a non-specialized reader,
and we will present author's text embeddings.
Then, we will focuss on the core part of this project : the compressed 
sensing part, and its application in text embeddings. Finally, we 
will present a reproduction of author's results, and discuss their
 statings and their implications.

\section{Text embeddings}

A text embedding is a vector representing a text. Usually, 
we want this representation to be low-dimensional, and to 
keep some information on the meaning of the text. By necessity, 
these representations are generally unsupervised : it would be 
hard to define a "standard" representation to be learned in a 
supervised way. In this section, we recall usual ways to 
learn to generate word embeddings - upon which lie LSTMs text embeddings -, 
text embeddings, and we explain in which ways they can be used for 
tasks as text classification.


\subsection{Word embeddings}

The very beginning of most popular
text embeddings is word embeddings. In this part
we will briefly explain how such embeddings are learned, and we will
set the definitions and the general context for the rest of the 
work. \\ \\
Supposing that we have a vocabulary 
$\mathcal{V} = \{w_1, ..., w_V \}$, of size 
$| \mathcal{V} | = V$, a natural vector representation of any word 
$w_i, i=1, ..., V$ is the following :
\begin{align*}
    w_i &= 
    \left (
    \begin{array}{c}
        0 \\
        \vdots \\
        0 \\
        1 \\
        0 \\
        \vdots \\
        0 \\
    \end{array}
    \right ) \leftarrow i,\ \ \ w_i \in \R^V
\end{align*}

The problem with this simple representation is the dimension ($V$)
and its sparsity ($||w_i||_0 = 1, \forall i= 1, ..., V$) of the vectors.
To adress this issue, many techniques have been proposed, especially 
in recent deep learning developments. Non-deep learning techniques 
are based on co-occurence matrices : 
given a set $\mathcal{D}$ of
documents, we first build a matrix containing the number of co-occurrences
of every word in all documents in a context window of size $c$, 
for instance :
\begin{align*}
    M&=
    \left (
    \begin{array}{ccc}
        C(w_1, w_1) & \dots & C(w_1, w_V) \\
            \vdots    & \ddots&   \vdots       \\
        C(w_V, w_1) & \dots & C(w_V, w_V) \\
    \end{array}
    \right ) \in \R^{V\times V}
\end{align*} 
Where $C(w_i, w_j)$ is the number of times that the word $w_j$ appears 
in the context of $w_i$, the context being defined as the 
words far from at most $c$ words from $w_i$ in any of the documents
in $\mathcal{D}$. This matrix is usually regularized using 
positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI). A word $w_i$
is then represented as the $i$-th line of $M$, or its
PPMI counterpart. However, this representation does not get rid
of dimension neither sparsity problems. Assuming the PPMI
matrix is very sparse, we use, as it is frequently
done in high-dimensional statistics,
a singular value decomposition $M^{\text{PPMI}} = W \times D \times C$, 
keeping only the $k$
most important singular values and vectors, leading to a new truncated
version of $W$, of size $V\times k$, which becomes the embedding
matrix, each line being a word's embedding. This decomposition
has good denoising and generalization properties. \\ \\
In parallel, the most popular deep learning embedding
is the Word2Vec embedding, proposed in \cite{NIPS2013_5021}. This 
embedding is learned by trying to predict a word from its context 
(CBOW), or vice versa to predict a context from a given word 
(skip-gram); using a 1-hidden layer feed-forward neural network
(Figure \ref{skip-arch}). 

\begin{center}
    \captionof{figure}{Skip-gram architecture for Word2Vec}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{skip-arch}
    \label{skip-arch}
\end{center}
Using some regularization and computationnal tricks during the training,
as replacing the softmax output function computation by a 
hierarchical softmax computation, or as using negative sampling loss
as an objective function, or doing frequency subsampling; which are 
detailed in \cite{Mikolov2013}; Word2Vec embeddings achieved better 
generalization and denoising properties than SVD. The main 
idea behind both Word2Vec and SVD embeddings, which makes them 
coherent as a good semantic representation, is called 
the distributionnal hypothesis. This linguistic hypothesis is built upon
Firth's statement that \textit{"a word is characterized by the 
company that it keeps"}. Thus, words employed in similar contexts
are more likely to have similar meanings. However, latest deep learning 
developments seem to have abandoned this approach, replaced by language modelling
as in \cite{howard2018universal, Peters_2018, devlin2018bert}, which 
are outside the scope of this project. \\ \\
The evaluation of such embeddings is difficult, as they are learned in an 
unsupervised way. However, two techniques are generally used to assess
embeddings representation quality : the evaluation of the embedding through
a downstream task, i.e. for instance the evaluation of classic text classifiers 
using the evaluated embedding as an input; and an evaluation through 
word similarities, with the objective that near vectors (regarding 
cosine distance) represent words with similar meanings. This evaluation
techniques are used in the same manner for text embeddings.

\subsection{From word embeddings to text embeddings}

In natural language processing, and more specifically in 
high-level tasks, there is no interest on studying single words. 
Thus, a natural question when working on texts, is : how to 
transform word embeddings to a single text embedding? In this section
we will describe 'natural' text embeddings, resembling the co-occurence
matrix described above, used in the article; and LSTMs embeddings, 
which are now more commonly used.

\subsubsection{Bag of n-Grams/Cooccurrences}

In this part, we will suppose that we have a vocabulary 
$\mathcal{V} = \{ v_1, ..., v_V\}$ and a document $d=w_1, ..., w_T$, 
where $w_i \in \mathcal{V}$ for any $i=1, ..., T$, and a fixed integer 
$n\in \N$. We recall 
that a $n$-gram is a sequence of $n$ words, 
for instance the set of unigrams is $\{v_1, ..., v_T \}$, the set 
of bigrams is $\{(v_1,v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_1, v_3) ..., (v_{V-1}, v_V) \}$, etc.
We let $V_k$ be the number of possible $k$-grams over $\mathcal{V}$,
independently of order ($V_1 = V$), and 
$V_n^{\text{sum}} = \sum_{k=1}^n V_k$.\\ \\
For any $k\in \N$, let $B_k$ be a vector indicating, 
for any possible $k$-gram over $\mathcal{V}$, the number 
of occurences of this $k$-gram in the document.
A Bag-of-$n$-Grams, denoted $x^{\text{BonG}}$ is the concatenation of all the $B_k$ vectors
for $k = 1, ..., n$ : 
\[
x^{\text{BonG}} = [B_1, ..., B_N]\]
In order to simplify and get rid of order in the n-grams, author
merge the $k$-grams in the vocabulary that are the same words in a 
different order. Then, we can write :
$B^{\text{Co-oc}}_k = \sum_{t=1}^{T-k+1} e_{ \{w_t, ..., w_{t+k-1}\}  }$. 
A Bag-of-$n$-Co-occurrences (BonC) is then :

\[
x^{\text{BonC}} = [B^{\text{Co-oc}}_1, ..., B^{\text{Co-oc}}_N]\]

These embeddings are sparse, $V_n^{\text{sum}}$-dimensional vectors.


\subsubsection{DisC embeddings}
This document embeddings relies on word embeddings. 
Supposing that we have learned word embeddings and that we denote
$x_{v_i} \in \R^d, d<<V$ the embedding of the word $v_i \in \mathcal{V}$, for any
$i=1,..., n$; and that we still have our document $d= w_1, ..., w_T$; 
then the unigram embedding of the document is :
\[z^u = \sum_{t=1}^T x_{w_t}\]
$z^u$ can be re-written as the product of a compression matrix $A$ 
in which columns are word embeddings $x_w$; and the "Bag-of-1-grams" document embedding : 

\[z^u = Ax^{\text{Bo1G}} = \sum_{t=1}^T A e_{w_t} = \sum_{t=1}^T x_{w_t} \]
Authors extend this unigram definition to $n$-co-occurrences by using
element-wise multiplication of word embeddings, defining: 
\[\tilde{x}_{\{w_1, ..., w_n\}} = d^{(n-1)/2} \odot_{t=1}^n x_{w_t} \ \ \in \R^d \]
Then, DisC (distributed co-occurence) embeddings are defined as
the concatenation of:

\[
    z^{(n)} = \left [ 
                C_1 \sum_{t=1}^T \tilde{x}_{w_t}, 
                ..., 
                C_n \sum_{t=1}^{T-n+1} \tilde{x}_{\{w_t, ..., w_t+n-1\}}
              \right ]
              \in \R^{nd}
\]
With $C_1,..., C_n$ being scaling factors, detailed later. As in the 
unigram case, DisC embeddings are directly related to compressed sensing
as we can find $A^{(n)}\in R^{dn \times V_n^{\text{sum}}}$ such that:
\[z^{(n)} = A^{(n)}x^{BonC} \]


\subsubsection{LSTMs}

LSTMs, which stands for Long-Short-Term Memory are a kind of recurrent
neural networks (RNN), introduced in \cite{Hochreiter:1997:LSM:1246443.1246450}.
As with classic RNNs, the point in LSTMs is to be able to 
handle sequential data, say for instance a document made of already 
embedded words :

\[   x =\{x_1, ..., x_T \} \]

\noindent A given LSTM cell $A$ 'evolves' with the time, and is caracterized in time 
by a \textit{hidden state} $h_t$ and a \textit{memory} $c_t$. We denote $A^{(t)}$ the state of cell
$A$ at time $t$. $A^{(t)}$   has three inputs : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $h_{t-1}$, the hidden state transmitted by the previous cell state $A^{(t-1)}$. 
    \item $c_{t-1}$, the memory transmitted by the previous cell state $A^{(t-1)}$.
    \item $x_t$, the 'real' sample input
\end{itemize}
And two outputs : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $h_{t}$, the updated hidden state transmitted to  $A^{(t+1)}$. 
    \item $c_{t}$, the updated memory transmitted to  $A^{(t+1)}$.
\end{itemize}
These inputs and outputs are schematized in Figure \ref{fig:LSTM1} \footnote{The figure is extracted from Christopher Olah's excellent blog : \href{http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/}{http://colah.github.io/}}. 
The core question of LSTMs is to define update rules for $h_t$ and $c_t$. First, we want to 
know how to update memory, or in other words, which informations to forget and which informations
to remember. To do so, we define :
\begin{itemize}
    \item $i_t = \sigma\left ( x_t U^i + h_{t-1} X^{i}\right) \in [0, 1]$, where $U^i, W^i$ are weights to learn.
         This function is called the \textit{input gate}. The input gate is a weighted sum of
         the sample data at time $t$ and the previous hidden state of the cell, regularized by the sigmoid function.
         The inpute gate decides, what new information we are going to store in the updated memory, and in
         which proportion, depending on the precedent data. 
    \item $\tilde{c}_t = \tanh \left ( x_t U^c + h_{t-1} X^{c}\right ) \in [-1, 1] $, where $U^c, W^c$ are weights to learn.
    $\tilde{c}_t$ is a candidate for creating 'new $c_{t}$ values'.
    \item $f_t = \sigma \left (x_t U^f + h_{t-1} X^{f}\right ) \in [0,1]$, where $U^f, W^f$ are weights to learn.
    This is called the \textit{forget gate}. The forget gate decides the proportion at which each element of the 
    memory is going to be forgotten.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The memory can then be updated, with respect to the following rule:
\begin{align*}
    c_t = f_t * c_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{c}_t
\end{align*}

\noindent Finally, to update the hidden state, we define the \textit{output gate} in the same fashion, and we update $h_t$ :

\begin{align*}
    o_t &= \sigma \left (x_t U^o + h_{t-1} X^{o}\right ) &\in& [0,1]  \\
    h_t &= \tanh (c_t) * o_t  &\in& [-1, 1]
\end{align*}




Some variants of LSTM cells may define input, output and forget gates differently. For instance,
the peephole version of LSTM implements the natural idea that the previous memory state $c_{t-1}$
has to be considered when deciding the input, output and forget rates.  GRU, Gated Recurrent Units 
are other variants of LSTMs. \\ \par 

\begin{center}
    \captionof{figure}{A representation of a LSTM cell in time}
    \label{fig:LSTM1}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{LSTM.png}
\end{center}
One question remains : what exactly is the hidden state $h$? 
$(h_t)_{t=1...T}$ can be viewed as the 'output' of the LSTM.  
In our case, the final hidden state $h_T$ is directly used as 
the document embedding. This representation of the document 
is unsupervised, and the LSTM is usually trained on another 
task, regarding which $(h_t)_{t=1...T}$ are features (see for 
instance \cite{Lample_2016} for an example of LSTMs trained 
for named entity recognition). 

Appart from having a very flexible and modular structure,
 LSTMs cells do not suffer of the same 
vanishing gradient problem as RNNs in practice,
 and are thus more effective
in modelling sequential data. They are particularly adapted 
to NLP problems because of their 
sequential nature. 


\subsection{Why text embeddings? }


Now that we have presented text embedding, we can present some of 
their most well-known applications. As text embeddings 
are a general, abstract, numerical representation for texts, 
they serve in many NLP tasks : text classification, and 
more specifically sentiment analysis (is a product review positive, 
negative, or neutral?), text similarity analysis, but 
also information retrieval. In information retrieval (IR), 
a common problem is to find the most relevant documents 
regarding a query. In classic IR systems, documents are compared 
with queries through co-occurence matrices, or through TF-IDF, 
which is commonly used in tech as it i a central part in 
Lucene and ElasticSearch algorithms. However, modern IR 
systems focuss on finding document and queries embeddings, 
in order to match the two by comparing them in a common 
latent space. Thus, text embeddings are useful in many 
machine learning tasks, but also in information retrieval 
problems.

\section{Text embedding as a Compressed Sensing problem}

Texts can be viewed as a collection of sparses measures (words) 
over a complex signal (ideas, a meaning, a sentiment, etc.). The
text embedding problem is thus directly a compressed sensing problem : 
using a compression (=embedding) matrix $A$ over a collection of 
words $x=w_1, ...w_T$ to produce a dense, compressed representation 
$z = Ax$, with good reconstruction qualities. As the "reconstruction"
quality of the compressed signal cannot, in this case, 
be properly evaluated, we need results on this reconstruction
quality through a downstream task as classification. 

\subsection{Results on compressed sensing for classification}

As we are interested in the evaluation of text embeddings through 
text classification, the compressed learning approach proposed 
in \cite{Calderbank2009CompressedL}, generalized and modified in 
our article of interest \cite{arora2018sensing} gives us a useful result :

\begin{theorem}
    For any subset $\mathcal{X}\subset \R^N$ containing the origin, 
    let $A\in \R^{d\times N}$ be $(\Delta, \mathcal{X})-$RIP, and $m$ 
    samples $S=\{ (x_i, y_i)\} \subset \mathcal{X}\times \{-1, 1\}$
    be drawn i.i.d. from the same distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over 
    $\mathcal{X}$, with $||x||_2 \leq R$. \\ 
    If $l$ is a $\lambda$-Lipschitz convex loss function and $w_0\in \R^N$
    is its minimizer over $\mathcal{D}$, then, with probability
    $1-2\delta$, the linear classifier $\hat{w}_A\in \R^d$ minimizing the 
    $l_2$-regularized empirical loss function $l_{S_A}+\frac{1}{2C} ||w||_2^2$
    over the compressed sample $S_A = \{(Ax_i, y_i) \}_{i=1}^m
    \subset \R^d \times \{-1, 1\} $ satisfies :
    \begin{align}
        l_{\mathcal{D}}(\hat{w}_A) &\leq 
        l_{\mathcal{D}}(w_0) + \mathcal{O}
        \left ( 
            \lambda R ||w_0||_2 \sqrt(\epsilon + \frac{1}{m}\log\frac{1}{\delta})
        \right )
    \end{align}
    for an appropriate choice of $C$, and recalling that
     $\Delta \mathcal{X} = \{x-x' : x, x' \in \mathcal{X} \}$, for 
     any $\mathcal{X}\subset \R^N$
